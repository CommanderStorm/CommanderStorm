# Hi, I’m Frank 👋

I’m a software engineer and open-source maintainer based in Munich, Germany, currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Informatics at TUM.

My work focuses on **high-performance backend systems**, **developer tooling**, and **FOSS-based infrastructure**.
I enjoy taking projects from “rough prototype” to **reliable, well-documented software with an active contributor community**.
